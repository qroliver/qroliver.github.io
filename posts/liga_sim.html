                The beautiful game, the most popular sport in the world. Football. Drama, joy, tension, passion, 
                unpredictability... A roller coaster of emotions played out over 90 minutes (or 120!), 
                for 9 months a year, shaping the fate of each club in every league / cup competition across the globe.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Will my club win the league? Qualify for a European competition? Avoid relegation? 
                Or is it finally the year we go up? Many questions, no certain answers. Unpredictability... 
                but is there a way to get a hint of what's to come, to predict the future?
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph" id="keep-reading">
                Well, short answer: no. But can we play fortune-tellers using Maths? 
                Let's try it, though in a (extremely) simple way. No need for super sophisticated computers and advanced 
                algorithms, let's just use the current season's stats, more specifically, expected goals, actual goals 
                scored and conceded, and Elo points to predict the final table of the Spanish

            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                For this small project, I will use R and the following packages: <code class="code-text"><i>tidyverse</i></code>, 
                <code class="code-text"><i>rvest</i></code>, <code class="code-text"><i>httr</i></code>,

                Let's kick off this project by fetching the full La Liga schedule, including all fixtures for the current season, 
                the current table, and each club's Elo points. First, let's get the schedule and the table. 
                These data are available on many websites, but I have used <a href="https://fbref.com/en/" target="_blank">FBref</a>'s, 
                which provides xG data calculated by <a href="https://www.statsperform.com/opta/" target="_blank">Opta</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                After fetching the La Liga schedule, I have a tibble called <code class="code-text"><i>la_liga_fixtures</i></code> 
                has 380 rows (one row per fixture) and 7 columns (figure 1): week (<i>wk</i>), <i>date</i>, home team (<i>home</i>), 
                expected goals for the home team (<i>xg</i>), <i>score</i>, expected goals for the visiting team (<i>xga</i>) 
                and visiting team (<i>away</i>).

                Now I will split this dataframe into two additional dataframes: one containing fixtures already played

                The model consists of two parts: one estimates probabilities using current game statistics (goals and expected 
                goals), while the other uses Elo points. The first part uses summary statistics for each club, 
                distinguishing between home and away games. More specifically, the statistics needed for each club are:
                <ul style="font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0;">
                    <li>mean xG (expected goals for).</li>
                    <li>mean GF (goals for) - xG difference.</li>
                    <li>standard deviation of GF - xG difference.</li>
                    <li>mean xGA (expected goals against).</li>
                    <li>mean GA (goals against) - xGA difference.</li>
                    <li>standard deviation of GA - xGA difference.</li>

            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                I calculated these statistics using the <code class="code-text"><i>la_liga_results</i></code> tibble,
                resulting in a new tibble called <code class="code-text"><i>la_liga_sum_stats</i></code>, distinguishing
                between home and away games for each club.

                Now that the data is gathered, it's time to develop the model.
            </p>
            <h3 id="model">Model.</h3>
            <h4>Part 1: goal-based.</h4>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                This first part of the model simulates the score of each fixture using key stats. For a given fixture, 
                the model uses a function (<code class="code-text"><i>simulate_fixture</i></code>) that retrieves the xG and xGA 
                for each team, and then adds a some randomness (we all know that football, and sports in general, are not 
                predictable... luckily!). Then, the model combines both a team's estimated goals scored with their opponent's 
                estimated goals conceded to make a prediction of goals scored by each team and thus predict the final score.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Let's walk through an example fixture: UD Las Palmas vs. FC Barcelona. The <code class="code-text"><i>simulate_fixture</i></code> 
                function begings by gathering the following stats:
                <ul style="font-size: 1.25rem; line-height: 1.5; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 0;">
                    <li>mean xG for UD Las Palmas' home games.</li>
                    <li>mean GF - xG difference for UD Las Palmas' home games.</li>
                    <li>standard deviation of the GF - xG difference for UD Las Palmas' home games.</li>
                    <li>mean xGA for UD Las Palmas' home games.</li>
                    <li>mean GA - xGA difference for UD Las Palmas' home games.</li>
                    <li>same as above for FC Barcelona, but for their away games.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Next, the function uses the Poisson distribution to simulate goals scored and conceded by each team, using mean 
                xG (or mean xGA) as lambda (average occurrence of an event within a given interval of time, in this case goals 
                over 90 minutes). After this, the function will add some randomness by adding a residual GF - xG difference 
                using a normal distribution (since in the long run the difference between goals scored and expected tends to 
                follow a Gaussian curve).
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The function will also use the same procedure to simulate the goals conceded by each team (the randomness will 
                be added as above, but using the GA - xGA difference). Finally, for each team, the goals scored by each team will 
                be determined by averaging their simulated goals scored and the simulated goals conceded by the opposition team.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Once the <code class="code-text"><i>simulate_function</i></code> is defined, the next step is to run a large 
                number of simulations (let's go with 10,000) to estimate probabilities later on (this is essentially Monte Carlo 
                simulation, where repeated random sampling is used to model different possible outcomes). For each simulation 
                and fixture, I want to keep track of the simulated score and, most importantly, the simulated outcome (i.e., 
                home win, draw or away win). To make things easier to follow, I will set up a progress bar to visualise the simulation's 
                progress.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                After running the chunk above, I now have a list with all the outcomes for each fixture and each simulation, as 
                well as another list with the results. The latter is not needed for the model, but it's more of a curiosity. 
                Let's say I want to challenge some friends to guess the score of the next fixture our team will play. For 
                example, let's look at that UD Las Palmas vs. FC Barcelona. What are the most likely scores, according to the 
                simulation above? In how many simulations UD Las Palmas win? Or sneak at least a point?
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                To find out, we have to join the simulated outcomes and scores with the league schedule. Then, we can calculate
                the frequency of each outcome for each fixture (which gives us probabilities; tibble called <code class="code-text">
                    <i>gb_probs</i>
                </code>). And, after this, we could 
                look at the most frequent scores for any given fixture by simply filtering by home and away teams. For example, 
                let's take a look at the already mentioned UD Las Palmas vs. FC Barcelona fixture (table 1 & figure 3).

                (8.81%). What seems certain according to the model is that it will be a game in which we will see some goals

                Next, I will calculate outcome probabilities using the formula 
                (from <a href="https://www.prosoccer.eu/betting-theory/elo-rating-system-predicting-football-matches/" target="_blank">prosoccer.eu</a>):

                $$ P_h = \frac{1}{1 + 10^{\frac{V_elo - H_elo - hfa}{400}}} $$

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                <i>P<sub>h</sub></i> refers to home win probability, <i>V<sub>elo</sub></i> is the Elo rating for the visiting 
                team, <i>H<sub>elo</sub></i> is the Elo rating for the home team and <i>hfa</i> represents the home field advantage.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                According to clubelo.com, as of 19 February 2025, the home field advantage in Spanish football is 
                <a href="http://clubelo.com/ESP" target="_blank">64.5 points</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The visiting team's win probability (<i>P<sub>a</sub></i>) is simply 1 - <i>P<sub>h</sub></i>. However, 
                this doesn't account for draws, so we need to adjust for that. To keep it as simple as possible, 
                I will use the following formula:
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                $$ P_d = B_d \times (1 - |P_h - P_a|) $$
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                <i>P<sub>d</sub></i> is the draw probability, <i>B<sub>d</sub></i> the baseline draw probability (calculated 
                from current statistics in the current league table), <i>P<sub>h</sub></i> is the home win probability, and 
                <i>P<sub>a</sub></i> is the away win probability. To calculate the baseline draw probability, I take the 
                average of the home team's draw frequency in home games and the visiting team's draw frequency in away games.

                Looking at the same fixture as before, this estimation gives UD Las Palmas a 16.6% chance of winning, 
                FC Barcelona a 73% chance, while the draw probability is 10.4%. Quite a difference, right? That's why we 
                move on to the final part, combining both models to calculate the final probabilities for each fixture.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Now it's time to combine both parts and calculate the final probabilities (figure 6) as well as run a simulation to predict 
                the final table. To calculate the final probabilities, I'll use a weighting factor (<i>&alpha;</i>) to give more weight to 
                the probabilities derived from Elo points. Arbitrarily, I will choose an <i>&alpha;</i> = 0.75, to keep things simple. 
                This value is entirely arbitrary, since I have decided to give more importance to each club's current strengths 
                (estimated by Elo points) than to the past performances (I'll discuss more about alpha at the end of this post).

                The model predicts a really tight title race between Real Madrid and Barcelona, with Real Madrid having a very 
                slight advantage (47.9% vs. 46.56% probability to win the league). Atlético are in third, though not far 
                behind, with less than 5 points separating them from Real Madrid or Barcelona in terms of average points 
                earned. In fact, looking at the projected points distributions, I would say it looks like a 3-horse race for 
                the title.

                What's clear is that one of these 3 teams will be crowned champions. Which club will join them in next season's 
                UEFA Champions League? According to the model, Athletic Club will finish fourth (66.78% probability, 68 points 
                expected on average), followed by Villarreal in the distance (19.85% probabilities of finishing 4<sup>th</sup>; 
                62 points expected on average). The model predicts Villarreal will finish 5<sup>th</sup>, thus earning them a 
                spot in next season's UEFA Europa League (or in the UEFA Champions League if Spain gets the extra spot).

                The fight for the last European spots will be very tight, with 9 clubs in close contention: Rayo Vallecano, 
                Mallorca, Betis, Real Sociedad, Girona, Osasuna, Sevilla, Getafe, and Celta. On average, the model predicts 
                just a 6-point difference between Rayo Vallecano (predicted to finish 6<sup>th</sup>) and Celta (predicted to 
                finish 14<sup>th</sup>). Looking at the projected points distribution, we can easily imagine that anything can

                The same is true for the fight to avoid relegation, except for Valladolid, who seem very unlikely to escape the 
                drop (84.96% probabilities to finish last, 97.55% probabilities to finish in the bottom 3). The other two 
                relegation spots will be decided in a very dramatic race between 5 clubs: Valencia, Leganés, Espanyol, and 
                Las Palmas. Even though the model gives Las Palmas a 44.35% relegation probability and Valencia only 24.89% 
                (the clubs with the highest and lowest relegation probability, after Valladolid; table 2), the 5 clubs are predicted to 
                finish the league with a point difference of just 2 points between them. It looks very very exciting and 
                dramatic as well!

            <h3 id="next">What's next?</h3>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                As stated above, this is a very simple model. It doesn't take into account multiple factors, like injuries, 
                player suspensions, other relevant stats, style of play, current form, etc. In addition, Elo points change over 
                time, and it is influenced by results and the strength of the opponent. This model does not take any of that 
                into consideration.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Further refinements of the model should aim to incorporate at least some of these factors. A first approach for 
                a new version of the model would be to adjust the key stats used (i.e., actual goals and expected goals) in a 
                dynamic manner, so that as the simulation runs the stats are updated after each fixture.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The same could be done with Elo points, by introducing a few lines of code that updates the Elo points of each 
                club as each fixture is simulated. This still wouldn't take into consideration other competitions played by the 
                clubs (such as European competitions or the Spanish Copa del Rey), which also affects Elo points.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Finally, another factor to consider is alpha, which I arbitrarily decided to set to 0.75, giving the 
                probabilities calculated using Elo points a much higher weight in the calculation of the final probabilities for 
                each fixture. A better way to calculate alpha could be by gathering historical results and try to estimate the 
                best value using machine learning algorithms.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Implementing those changes (or some of them) should improve the model, and I might give it a go in the future. 
                It could be fun to try and see how accurate the predictions are (although no model will ever be able to predict 
                the future).
