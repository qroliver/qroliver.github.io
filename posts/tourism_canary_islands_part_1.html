                        Located at the crossover of three continents, the Canary Islands are well known as one of the main tourists 
                        destinations for Europeans. Often referred to as <em>The Fortunate Islands</em> in ancient times, the 
                        islands enjoy a mild climate that allows for outdoor activities all year round. Locals and visitors can 
                        explore the many natural attractions in the islands, including diverse and stunning landscapes, four 
                        national parks, volcanoes, rainforests, long sandy beaches, a rich and extraordinary gastronomy, etc., 
                        all wrapped in an easy-going way of living that make the Canary Islands a dream destination for many.

                        In fact, with over 95 millions in 2023, the Canary Islands were the EU region with the highest number of 
                        nights spent in tourist accommodations (figure 1), surpassing popular tourist destinations such as Adriatic 
                        Croatia, Île-de-France (where Paris is), Catalonia (Barcelona), Veneto (Venice), Balearic Islands, Tuscany 
                        (Florence) or Lazio (Rome).

                        evolved over recent years. This will give us a snapshot of the current state of this industry in the 
                        archipelago, and will set the stage to explore its socioeconomic impact in the islands (in a future post).

                                In 2005, 11.3 million tourists arrived in the Canary Islands. By 2024, this number had increased to 
                                17.8 millions (+57.5%). Between 2005 and 2013 growth was relatively modest (+7.7%), likely due to 
                                the global financial crisis. After that, tourist arrivals soared in the period 2013-17, rising by 
                                31.1% in just four years.

                                sharp decline in arrivals due to global travel restrictions. However, there was a major rebound 
                                already by 2022, with visitor number nearly reaching the pre-pandemic levels. This upward trend 
                                continued in 2023 and 2024, with both years setting new records.

                                Over the past 15 years, tourists visiting the Canary Islands have, on average, spent more each 
                                year (aside from the temporary mild drop during the COVID-19 pandemic; figure 6). In 2024, the 
                                average daily expenditure per tourist and day was 55.3% higher than in 2010. A signifcant part 
                                of this increase has taken part in the post-COVID years. Thus, compared with 2019, daily 
                                spending per tourist and day rose by 29.2% in 2024. To put some context, accumulated inflation 
                                in Spain between 2010 and 2024 was 29.01%, whereas for the period 2019-2024 this was 19.08%

                                Over the period between 2009 and 2024 there is a clear long-term upward trend in total income, 
                                despite some year-to-year variation (figure 7). Between 2009 until 2017, annual income grew 
                                steadily at rates between 6.6 and 15% every year, with the exception of 2012. This was followed 
                                by a slight drop in 2018 and virtually no change in 2019.

                                The impact of COVID-19 in 2020 caused a sharp drop in income, but the recovery from 2021 onwards 
                                was quick and consistent. In fact, the period 2022-2024 have seen unprecedented figures, with 
                                the tourist sector breaking income records each year. By 2024, the total income had increased 
                                by 41.8% compared to pre-pandemic levels (2019), and by 157% compared to 2009.

                        The numbers above point to a clear conclusion: the tourist sector in the Canary Island has never been 
                        stronger. Visitor numbers have reached record highs in recent years, particularly across the four main 
                        destinations: Tenerife, which is the most popular island, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, and Fuerteventura. 
                        Tourists have never spent more than they did in 2024, and the industry has never generated as much 
                        income as last year. And looking at the current trend, 2025 may well be another record-breaking year.

                        But, what does all of this mean for the locals? Are their living conditions improving alongside the 
                        booming tourist industry? And what about the environment? The Canary Islands are full of unique natural 
                        spaces that are also very fragile... and can easily be damaged if not properly protected.

                        socioeconomic indicators to explore these questions further... and shed light on why many (myself 
                        included) believe it's time for a change. But that's for another post. Stay tuned!
