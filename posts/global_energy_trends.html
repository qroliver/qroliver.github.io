                Energy production and consumption are at the core of technological development, economic growth, and, in 
                general, human well-being. Already from the very beginning of our civilisation, when early humans figured 
                out how to control fire, allowing them to better resist cold temperatures or to cook their food, energy has 
                been central to our development. The Industrial Revolution, healthcare advancements, food production and 
                storage, transport systems, etc. would never have been possible without increasing production and consumption 
                of energy.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph" id="keep-reading">
                But there is a dark side to this progress. Energy production comes at a huge environmental cost. We continuously 
                need to extract more and more natural resources to meet the growing demand, and we need to transform those raw 
                materials into usable energy. Mining, drilling, altering water courses, refining and burning raw materials to 
                produce usable forms of energy, etc. have a significant impact on the planet. A clear example of this is gas 
                emissions derived from burning fossil fuels, which greatly contribute to global warming and climate change.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                After the Industrial Revolution that marked a major turning point in human history, coal first and oil later 
                have been the main energy sources powering much of our progress. These provide much of the energy we have 
                consumed and we consume today, but they come with a huge downside: massive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, with the 
                enormous impact that has on global warming and climate change. In a world with a growing population and rapid 
                technological development, finding sustainable energy sources that meet demand and minimise the impact on the 
                global environment is now more important than ever before.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In this project, I'll take a closer look at global energy consumption trends, exploring global and regional 
                patterns, the energy mix, and the link between energy consumed and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. So, without 
                further ado, let's dive right in!

            <h3 id="data">Data.</h3>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                For this project, I used data from the 2024 Statistical Review of World Energy (last available) from the 
                Energy Institute, freely available on their 
                <a href=https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review/resources-and-data-downloads target="_blank">website</a>. 
                This dataset contains historical data (from 1965 until 2023) on various energy-related variables across multiple 
                countries worldwide, as well as aggregated data by region, geopolitical organisation, and globally. To 
                learn more about how I processed it for this project, click

            <h3 id="global_consumption">Global energy consumption.</h3>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Primary energy consumed refers to the total amount of energy used in its raw form (i.e., before any coversion 
                losses, like inefficiencies in electricity generation, etc.). This includes fossil fuels, nuclear and renewable 
                energy, and it provides a snapshot of the energy demand in a given territory. In addition, it is also a good 
                indicator of economic activity and technological development.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                I'll kick off this analysis by looking at how the global primary energy consumption has evolved over the years. 
                It's important to keep in mind that the energy consumption is closely tied to population growth, so let's plot 
                both the global primary energy consumption and the world population to get a clearer picture.
            </p>
            <figure class="entry-figure" id="figure01">

            </figure>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Primary energy consumption worldwide has steadily increased over the last few decades, in line with a growing 
                world population (figure 1). It's interesting to see a few small dips in energy consumption along the way. For 
                instance, there were recent drops in 2008 and 2020, which align with the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 
                pandemics, respectively. These drops didn't last long, and the primary energy consumption increased to higher 
                levels the following year.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Similarly, if we go a bit further back in time, we can also see two small plateaus (1973-5 and 1979-83), which 
                coincide with the 1973 and 1979 oil crisis, respectively.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The primary energy consumption per capita has also increased over time (figure 2), with some fluctuations, and 
                at a slower rate than total global primary energy consumption. There was a sharp rise from 1965 (the earliest 
                data) until 1973. After this, likely due to the 1973 oil crisis, consumption per capita dropped slightly in 
                1974-5. This was followed by another sharp increase until the 1979 oil crisis, which likely caused another dip 
                in the early 1980s.
            </p>
            <figure class="entry-figure" id="figure02">

            </figure>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                After this, there was an upward trend through the middle and late 1980s, before consumption dropped again, 
                possibly as a consequence of events like the economic reforms associated with the USSR's Perestroika, the fall 
                of the Berlin Wall, and the collapse of the USSR. These events led to, among other things, the closure of 
                energy-intensive industries or a drastic reduction in production, which impacted energy consumption.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                China's economic reforms in the 1980s and 1990s led the country to a rapid industrialisation process and its 
                integration into the global economy. The modern era of globalisation had begun, and China quickly became a 
                major manufacturing hub (in a way, <i>the factory of the world</i>). This helped mitigate the dip in energy 
                consumption and, as China and other countries developed, energy consumption significantly rose again until the 
                late 2000s, when the 2008 financial crisis struck.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In the first half of the 2010s, consumption per capita remained relatively stable. The effects of the 2008 
                financial crash, growing awareness of energy efficiency, and the shift towards more sustainable energy could 
                be among the factors that explain this phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Economic growth resumed in the late 2010s, and consumption per capita started climb again until 2020. Then, 
                the COVID-19 pandemics hit, and much of the world went into a lockdown, causing a dip in energy consumption 
                per capita. However, this effect didn't last long, and the world quickly recovered. Energy consumption levels 
                bounced back and have remained on a sharp upward trend since 2021, reaching an all-time high in 2023.

            <h3 id="consumption_by_region">Energy consumption by region.</h3>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                We've just seen that the primary energy consumption has steadily increased over time, reaching its highest level 
                in 2023. But, if we look at a regional level, is this trend the same everywhere, or are there significant 
                differences across different parts of the world? To answer this, let's take a look at the primary energy 
                consumption per capita across the main regions defined in the dataset (Asia Pacific, CIS, Europe, Middle East, 
                North America, South & Central America, and Africa).
            </p>
            <figure class="entry-figure" id="figure03">

            </figure>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In 2023, there was a significant disparity in the energy consumed per capita across different regions 
                (figure 3). North America topped the list (with around 230 EJ per capita), followed by the Commonwealth of 
                Independent States (with 163.7 EJ per capita, notably lower than North America). The Middle East followed with 
                142.9 EJ per capita, and Europe was in fourth (115.2 EJ per capita). At the other end, Asia Pacific was fifth 
                (67.3 EJ per capita), South & Central America sixth (58.3 EJ per capita), whereas Africa sat at the bottom 
                (with 14.3 EJ per capita).
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                That was the picture in 2023 (the most recent data in the dataset), but has it always like this? Let's take a 
                look at the how the primary energy consumption per capita has evolved over the last few decades. Thus, the data 
                shows that already back in 1965 North America was the region with the largest consumption per capita in 1965, 
                reaching its peak in the 1970s (figure 4). After 1979, there is a small and steady decline over time, becoming 
                more noticeably after the turn of the century. Whereas the oil crisis in the 1970s could have had a role in 
                1980s, the decline observed in the last 20-25 could possibly be linked to two main factors: industrial 
                delocalisation and improvement of energy efficiency.
            </p>
            <figure class="entry-figure" id="figure04">

            </figure>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The Commonwealth of Independent States saw an increase in consumption until late 1980s. After this point, that 
                coincides with the collapse of the USSR, there was a sharp drop in consumption per capita until the late 1990s, 
                even falling behind Europe for a brief period of time. Since then, there has been a subtle upwards trend until 
                2023.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Europe's consumption has remained somewhat stable over the last 60 years. There was an increasing trend from 
                the 1960s until the mid 1980s. After this, the consumption per capita in Europe remained more or less stable 
                until the late 2000s, when a small and gradual decrease started, continuing through to 2023. Like North America, 
                this constant decrease could relate to both energy efficiency and industrial delocalisation.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The Middle East stands out for having the most pronounced increase in primary energy consumption per capita 
                over the last decades. This rise is gradual and almost continuous, to the point that, from 2011, this regions's 
                consumption per capita is larger than Europe's and keeps closing in on the CIS's. This growth is likely tied to 
                the region's development and modernisation in recent decades, driven by the oil and natural gas industries.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Asia Pacific has also seen a significant rise in consumption over the last decades, recently surpassing South & 
                Central America. This increase is more noticeable in the last 30 years, which could be explained by rapid 
                industrialisation (with China becoming somehow the factory of the world) and a higher level of urbanisation.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                South & Central America shows a subtle upwards trend, but very slow. There was even a small dip in the late 
                2010s, with a quick recovery after that.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Finally, Africa's per capita consumption has also grown over the past 60 years (from ~8 EJ in 1965 to ~14 in 
                2023). It is interesting to see that there wasn't much of a difference between Africa and Asia Pacific until 
                the 1990s. Since then, Asia Pacific's consumption started increasing at a much higher rate than Africa's. In 
                Africa, the energy consumption per capita remains relatively low, probably due to lack of industrialisation 
                and limited access to resources.

                In 2023, Qatar was by far the country with the largest primary energy consumption per capita (around 817 EJ/per 
                capita), followed by Iceland and Singapore (~603 and ~577 EJ / per capita, respectively; figure 5). Among the 
                top consumers, we can find several oil- and natural gas-producing countries from the Middle East, like Qatar, 
                United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Oman, likely due to their energy-intensive oil and gas industries.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                North America is represented on this list by Canada and the USA. These are big countries with large economies, 
                high living standards, and cold climate in big parts of their territory, all factors that demand a large amount 
                of energy.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Some European countries also appear on the list of top consumers, although, interestingly, not the countries 
                with the largest economies in the continent. Thus, Germany, United Kingdom and France, countries with a strong 
                industrial and mining history, are not among the top consumers. A possible explanation for their absence could 
                be a shift towards more efficient energetic systems, the shutting down of the mining industry, and a gradual 
                industrial delocalisation away from these nations.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Northern European countries like Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden rank among the top consumers, likely due 
                to their cold climate that requires high energy for heating (Denmark, which has a milder climate than the other 
                Nordic countries, does not appear among the top 20 consumers in 2023).

                Other countries on this list are Singapore, a major financial hub in South East Asia; South Korea, a highly 
                industrialised economy; Australia, a big country with long distances to cover and a significant mining sector; 
                Trinidad & Tobago, an economy largely dependent on oil and gas production; and Turkmenistan, one of the 
                countries with the largest natural gas reservoirs in the world, along with significant amounts of oil as well.

                play a bigger role in the energy we consume? Are there any differences between regions and countries? In a 
                world facing the massive challenge of global warming and climate changing represent, how much of our energy 
                comes from renewable sources? Quite a few questions to answer, so let's get some answers.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In a world facing the enormous challenge of global warming and climate change, reducing our dependence of 
                fossil fuels and transitioning to cleaner, less polluting energy sources is critical for the future of our 
                planet. As we saw earlier, fossil fuels are by far the main energy source worldwide, likely due to its energy 
                density, cost and availability.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Renewables, on the other hand, produced less than 15% of the total primary energy we consumed in 2023. 
                Ideally, we should quickly increase the share of energy produced from renewable sources, while gradually 
                reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, to mitigate the negative effect that they have on our environment. 
                Are we actually making that transition? If so, how fast are we doing it? Is there a reason to be optimistic?
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Let's take a look at the historical evolution of renewables, fossil fuels and nuclear energy consumption over 
                the past few decades (figure 10). Fossil fuels have remained the dominant energy source globally in the last 
                decades, although their share has been gradually declining. In 1965, around 93.4% of the global primary energy 
                we consumed was produced using fossil fuels, while very little or almost nothing was produced using renewable 
                or nuclear sources (~6.4% and ~0.17, respectively). By 2023, the share of fossil fuels had dropped to 81.5%, 
                and renewable sources made up ~14.6% of the global energy mix.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The share of renewables in the global energy mix remained relatively stable until the mid-2000s, when 
                significant growth began, going from accounting for 7.3% of the global energy mix in 2003 to 14.6% in 2023. 
                This shift coincided with a gradual decline in the use of fossil fuels.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The use of nuclear energy saw a modest increase in the 1970s, possibly linked to the 1973 and 1979 oil crisis 
                (it actually coincides with the beginning of the drop in the use of fossil fuels), reaching its peak in the 
                late 1990s to early 2000s. After that, its share began to decline, a trend that aligns with the increasing 
                adoption of renewable energy and growing concerns about the potential dangers of the nuclear energy, such as 
                toxic waste, and bad public image, especially after incidents like those in the Chernobyl's and Fukushima's 
                nuclear power plants.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                As a result, many countries have opted to phase out nuclear powerplants in favour of renewable sources, and 
                this is something we can see in the global trend. Summarising, the use of fossil fuels is gradually declining, 
                along with an increase in renewable energy. This goes in line with policies implemented in many countries to 
                gradually reduce the carbon footprint and transitioning away from the most polluting energy sources. But it 
                looks like we still have a long way to go until renewable sources become the main contributor in our global 
                energy mix.

                Most of the energy we consume comes from burning fossil fuels, which release CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. 
                This has a tremendous environmental impact, as CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are one of the major drivers of global 
                warming and climate change. Thus, it is crucial to track how much CO<sub>2</sub> is being emitted and understand

                was a brief decline in emissions per capita (probably the collapse of the USSR had something to do with this), 
                but, in the 2000s, there was a sharp increase until 2007.

                then a modest increase until 2018. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemics hit the world and caused the CO<sub>2</sub> 
                emissions per capita to significantly drop. From this point, the emissions per capita increased stadily again,

                Going down to the country level, in 2023, nations with economies largely dependent on fossil fuels were, 
                unsurprisingly, the countries with the largest CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita (figure 13). Qatar topped 
                the list (Qatar was also the country with the largest primary energy consumed in 2023), with a significant gap 
                to the second.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Following Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Turkmenistan, Kuwait and Oman complete the top 5. All of these are 
                countries with strong fossil fuel industries, mainly oil and natural gas. Within the top 10 we can also find 
                Australia, Canada and the USA, which are big countries, with large economies and strong fossil fuel/mining 
                industry.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The first European countries on this list are Russia, which is also a big country, one of the largest economies 
                in the world, and with a strong fossil fuel industry, ranking 11<sup>th</sup>; and Estonia, one of the largest 
                oil shale producers in the world, ranking 14<sup>th</sup>.

            <h4>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions vs. primary energy consumption per capita & renewable energy share.</h4>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In general, there seems to be a trend where high primary energy consumption per capita correlates with higher 
                CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita (figure 14). However, this correlation is not absolute. Some countries, 
                like Norway, have relatively low CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita despite high energy consumption. This is 
                likely because a significant part of the energy consumed comes from renewable sources. Another example is 
                Sweden, with significantly lower emissions than other countries with similar consumption, and with an extensive 
                use of renewable energy.

                In general, countries with a significant share of renewables in their energy mix tend to have lower emissions 
                per capita than those with similar consumption and little or no use of renewables. However, there are also 
                exceptions to this. For instance, Trinidad & Tobago has lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per capita than countries 
                with similar primary consumption per capita (for example, Kuwait's consumption is similar to Trinidad & Tobago, 
                but emits more than twice as much CO<sub>2</sub> per capita).
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                On the other hand, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan are also exceptions to the general trend. These countries, with 
                economies largely reliant on fossil fuel production, have higher CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than countries with 
                similar primary energy consumption per capita.

            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In summary, broadly speaking, the carbon's footprint of a country comes determined not only by the amount of 
                primary energy consumed, but also the energy mix plays a crucial role.

            <h3 id="wrap-up">Wrapping-up.</h3>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                The world is consuming more energy than ever before, both in term of total global consumption and per capita, 
                with a significant increase over the last few decades. This is likely driven by different factors like growing 
                population, industrial expansion (with special focus on emerging economies), growing international trade, 
                technological advancements, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Looking at a regional level, North America has been the region with the highest consumption per capita over the 
                last few decades, although its consumption has been on a slight downward trend over the last 20 years. The CIS 
                ranked second in 2023, the Middle East third while, at the other end, Africa was the region with the lowest 
                consumption per capita.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                At country level, nations with strong fossil fuel industries or cold climates that require extensive energy for 
                heating dominate the list of top consumers. However, this is not always the case. Qatar topped the list in 2023, 
                followed by Iceland and Singapore. While Qatar's high energy consumption is largely due to its strong fossil fuel 
                industry, and Iceland's high consumption could be related to a very cold climate, Singapore's highly consumption 
                is likely due to its strong financial sector.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Fossil fuels continue to be the main source in our energy mix (accounting for over 80% of primary consumption), 
                despite the growing awareness of their negative environmental impact. In 2023, most of the energy consumed 
                globally came from oil (31.7%), followed by coal (26.5%), while less than 15% came from renewable sources.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                If we look at a regional level, there are some differences across the globe. While fossil fuels remained as 
                the main source for all regions in 2023, their share in the energy mix varies. The Middle East relies the most 
                on fossil fuels (>97% of its energy comes from these), whereas South & Central America is where fossil fuels 
                had the lowest share (63.9%).
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                Renewable energy use also shows significant disparities across regions. While it's almost non-existent in the 
                Middle East, it's becoming increasingly important in regions like South & Central America (35.4% of the energy 
                consumed in 2023 came from renewable sources) and Europe (where renewables accounted for 22.9% of the energy 
                mix). Among the countries with the largest share of renewables in their energy mix in 2023, Nordic countries 
                dominate, with four of these nations appearing in the top 5 (all five Nordic countries appear in the top 10).
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                While the share of renewables in the energy mix has grown, along with a decline in the use of fossil fuels, 
                over the last couple of decades, it's still very far from reaching the levels of fossil fuels (14.6% vs. 81.5% 
                of the global energy mix in 2023). Thus, it seems that we have started a transition towards renewable energy, 
                but the pace is far too slow and a shift is not likely to happen in the near or mid-term future.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                This reliance on fossil fuels has a significant toll on our environment. Thus, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions keep 
                rising, and the trend of the last few decades suggests that we are still far from curbing emissions. 
                Unsurprisingly, there appears to be a correlation between energy consumption per capita and CO<sub>2</sub> 
                emissions, with higher consumption leading to higher emissions. Additionally, countries with a higher share of 
                renewables in their energy mix generally tend to have lower emissions.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In a world with a growing population and fast technological advancements that demand ever-increasing energy, 
                transitioning towards cleaner and more efficient energy sources is crucial for ensuring a sustainable future 
                for our planet. While this transition seems to have started, its pace is still too slow, and the shift from 
                fossil fuels to renewables seems to be very distant in time.
            </p>
            <p class="entry-paragraph">
                In light of the discoveries and forecasts from climate scientists, it's vital to accelerate the implementation 
                of policies aimed at phasing out fossil fuels quickly, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and reducing 
                drastically our CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. This is essential to ensure a future for our planet and, therefore, 
                for ourselves. Our energy access and human progress rely on that. We know it. Now it's time to act without delay.
