                    Lanzarote is the northernmost and easternmost of the Canary Islands. Located 125 km off the coast of 
                    continental Africa (figure 1), its subtropical climate is characterised by mild temperatures all year-round and 
                    little precipitation. Sometimes referred to as the <i>island of eternal Spring</i>, Lanzarote's climate 
                    is classified as hot dessert climate according to the Köppen climate classification.

                    I downloaded temperature and precipitation data from the last 50 years recorded 
                    at the station located at Lanzarote airport, with the aim of analysing possible trends over this period.

                    Before continuing, I would like to point out that Lanzarote, like other Canary islands, is characterised by 
                    having more than one microclimate. For example, the northern and north-western areas are more exposed to the 
                    chilly oceanic <i>alisios</i> (trade winds) that blow from the northeast, making these parts of the island a 
                    bit cooler and slightly more humid than areas to the south and southeast. However, due to the relatively low 
                    altitude of Lanzarote, the differences between the microclimates on this island are not as pronounced as on 
                    other islands with higher mountains (like Tenerife or La Palma).

                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    With that in mind, let's start by having a look at annual mean temperatures over the last 50 years. As seen in 
                    figure 2, there is a long-term warming trend, mirroring what's happening worldwide. The mean annual temperature 
                    has increased above 2°C in the last 50 years, with 2023 marking the warmest year on record (22.71°C).

                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    To find the coldest year within this period, we have to go back to 1974, which had a mean temperature of 
                    19.65°C. This year, together with 1973 and 1975 are the only years in the last five decades with a mean 
                    temperature below 20°C in the last 50 years. As we move forward in time to more recent years, annual mean 
                    temperatures consistently go above 20, 21 and even 22°C in recent years, like 2022 and 2023. Except the 
                    years 2018 and 2019, most recent years have recorded mean temperatures around or above 21.5°C.

                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    When using the period 1981-2010 as a reference, we can see significant positive temperature anomalies in 
                    recent years, with 2023 showing the largest anomaly (+1.58°C; figure 3). By contrast, most negative anomalies 
                    occurred in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s.

                    In the last 20 years, only 2005 and 2018 had very mild negative temperature anomalies (-0.04 and -0.26°C, 
                    respectively, which are almost negligible). The other 18 years within this period had positive temperature 
                    anomalies, with 2010, 2022 and 2023 standing out for having anomalies above 1°C.

                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    If we look at the mean temperature by decade (figure 4), we can see a significant increase, following almost a 
                    linear path (0.3-0.4°C increase per decade) in the last 30 years. The 1970s (data from 1973 to 1979) were the coldest 
                    period, with an average temperature of 20°C, whereas the 2020s are the warmest period so far, averaging 22.1°C.

                    An interesting observation is that the mean temperature of the period 2020-2023 is already 0.4°C higher than 
                    that of the 2010s. If we look at the trend of annual mean temperatures, it wouldn't be surprising if this 
                    temperature increase becomes even more pronounced by the end of the decade (potentially exceeding the 0.8°C 
                    rise observed between the 1970s and 1980s).

                    months have seen the greatest temperature rise, with June, May and April having average temperatures over 2.5°C

                    June is the month that has experienced the highest average temperature rise, with 2.91°C in the last 50 years, 
                    followed by May (2.76°C). Another month that stands out is October, experiencing a 2.64°C increase in the last

                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    Lanzarote is an island with scarce precipitation that falls mainly during winter months. Historically, the 
                    precipitation patterns on the island have been highly irregular, with some years recording relatively high 
                    amount (considering the island's low average rainfall), and others experiencing very dry conditions. And this 
                    variability is something we can clearly see in the last 50 years (figure 6).

                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    With such an irregular pattern, it is hard to establish a clear trend. However, we can clearly observe the 
                    high variability in figure 6, which shows the total rainfall per year in the last five decades. As mentioned 
                    above, an irregular pattern can easily be spotted. 1989 was the wettest year of the last 50 years, with 298.2 
                    mm rainfall, while 2023 was the driest, with only 39.5 mm rainfall.

                    Using the reference period 1981-2010, we can try to gain extra insights into how annual precipitation has 
                    deviated from the norm. Figure 7 shows the precipitation anomalies expressed as percentage deviation from the 
                    average of the reference period. From these data, we can spot a wetter period in the late 1980s-early 1990s, 
                    with 5 consecutive years having a positive rain anomaly. In this period, 1989 is the year having the largest 
                    positive anomaly (+169.55%), marking the highest positive deviation in the last 50 years.

                    In contrast, recent years have tended to be drier. Four out of the last five years had a negative anomaly, 
                    with 2023 standing out as the driest year in the series (-64.3%). It looks like the current is a dry period, 
                    in contrast to the period 1987-1991, and similar to the period 1997-2003 (and possibly the period before 1979).

                <h3 id="conclusions">Concluding remarks.</h3>
                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    Like the rest of the world, Lanzarote is facing significant climate challenges, with clear evidences of a 
                    significant warming over the last decades (+3°C in 50 years). Combined with an irregular and scarce 
                    precipitation pattern, this trend poses significant challenges for the island, particularly regarding water 
                    resources and the local economy, which mainly relies on tourism.
                </p>
                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    One of the main attractions of Lanzarote is its stable and mild temperatures throughout the year, which makes 
                    the island a perfect destination for those escaping extreme heat or cold elsewhere (mainly in Europe). The 
                    current warming trend threatens this appeal, and could have a profound impact on the island's traditional 
                    touristic seasons: winter months and July-August. With increasingly hotter summers, July and August could 
                    become less attractive for tourists, potentially turning what is now a high season into a low season. This 
                    could have deep implications in the island's economy, where tourism is by far the main driver.
                </p>
                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    More critically, this warming trend poses a great risk for the welfare of the island's inhabitants, and not 
                    only due to an economy affected by a potential shifts in the touristic sector. Rising temperatures, combined 
                    with low and irregular rainfall, could add more pressure on and already highly pressured water supply system, 
                    which relies heavily on energy-demanding desalinisation. This has multiple implications on daily life, one of 
                    them being the local agriculture, with increasing cost of living for residents.
                </p>
                <p class="entry-paragraph">
                    This warming trend adds to the challenges the island is already facing, and will continue to face, in regards 
                    to living conditions, economy and environmental sustainability. With very limited resources, immediate action 
                    should be taken by the authorities to ensure adaptation to this new and challenging reality.
