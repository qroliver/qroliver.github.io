                        As I showed in a previous <a href="https://www.oliverqr.com/blog/tourism_canary_islands_part_1" target="_blank">post</a>, 
                        the tourism industry in the Canary Islands has never been stronger than it is today. Visitor numbers have 
                        repeadly set new records, average spending per tourist have climbed to unprecedented levels, and the sector 
                        is generating more revenue year after year. And it seems that 2025 will be another record-breaking year.

                        A booming industry with impressive figures, undoubtedly — but how does all this impact the locals? Are 
                        Canarians truly benefitting from this bonanza? In this second part, I aim to answer that question by looking 
                        at some socioeconomic indicators and seeing how the Canary Islands compare to other Spanish regions.

                                Over the past years, Canarian authorities have repeatedly emphasised the importance of diversifying 
                                the archipelago's economy, aiming to reduce dependence on tourism. However, the data suggest that 
                                this goal has not been achieved. In 2010, the direct contribution of the tourism sector to the 
                                regional GDP was 25%, while by 2024 it had risen to 36.8% (figure 1).

                                The trend has been steadily upward — only disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic — making the Canary 
                                Islands' ecomomy increasingly reliant on tourism. In fact, 2024 marks an all—time high. Among 
                                Spanish regions, the Canary Islands rank second in terms of tourism's direct share of GDP, only 
                                slightly behind the Balearic Islands (~40% iin 2023). Notably, these two regions are the only ones 
                                in which tourism contributes more than 16% directly to the regional GDP (IMPACTUR data).

                                The rising contribution of tourism to the regional GDP has also a clear effect on the job market. In 
                                2024, the tourism sector directly generated 39.4% of all jobs in the Canary Islands, up from 30% in 
                                2010 (figure 2). This steady upward trend reflects the increasing reliance of the local economy on 
                                tourism for employment as well, only being disrupted temporarily by the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, 
                                current values are already back to pre-pandemic levels.

                                Among Spanish regions, only the Balearic Islands (around 40%) have a similar proportion of jobs directly

                                less than those in Madrid, the region with the highest average salary.

                                (figure 4). Salaries also appear particularly vulnerable to disruptive events. For example, during COVID-19,

                                Not surprisingly — given the combination of low wages and high unemployment — the Canary Islands 
                                rank among the Spanish regions with the highest level of poverty (figure 7). In 2024, 24.6% of the 
                                population was at risk of poverty, well above the national average (19.7%) and more than double the 
                                rate observed in the Balearic Islands. Particularly striking is that, despite the tourism boom, 
                                the share of people at risk of poverty in the Canary Islands is virtually unchanged from twenty 
                                years (24.4% in 2004; Eurostat data, not shown).

                                affecting 10.8% of the population — again above both Spain's national average (8.3%) and more than 
                                double the Baleric Islands' rate (4.3%; figure 7).

                                A similar pattern emerges when looking at the percentage of people who cannot afford a protein-rich 
                                meal every second day, often used as an indicator of food insecurity. The Canary Islands stand out 
                                as the worst-performing region in Spain, with 10.3% of the population affected — 2.34 times the 
                                Balearic Islands' rate (4.4%) and well above Spain's national average (6.1%; figure 7).

                                While both tourism arrivals and revenue have reached record levels, the living standards have not 
                                kept pace, and in many indicators the Canary Islands perform among the worst in Spain. This raises 
                                the question of how the income distribution is in the archipelago. With low salaries and high 
                                poverty despite a booming tourism sector, it seems reasonable to suspect that income inequality 
                                might be relatively high — and the data confirm this.

                                In 2024, the S80/S20 ratio of the Canary Islands was 5.5, meaning that the income of the richest 20% 
                                of the population was 5.5 times higher than that of the poorest 20% (figure 8). This places the 
                                archipelago as one of the regions with higher income inequality in Spain — with a value similar to 
                                Andalusia and Madrid, and significantly above the Balearic Islands (4.4). Across the EU, the Canary 
                                Islands rank among the regions with the highest income inequality, with an S80/S20 ratio 2.2 times 
                                higher than that of the region with the lowest inequality (Bratislavský kraj, with a ratio of 2.5

                            Taken together, the data paints a clear picture. The tourism sector is booming, but locals are not 
                            benefitting from it. Despite new records in both arrivals and revenue generated year after year, wages 
                            remain among the lowest in Spain — if not the lowest —, unemployment is persistently among the highest, 
                            and a significant share of the population faces poverty, material and social deprivation, or even 
                            struggles to afford protein-rich meals.

                            Income inequality is also among the highest in Spain — and in the EU —, suggesting that the wealth 
                            generated in the islands is far from being evenly distributed. This points to a scenario in which the 
                            economic gains from tourism either are concentrated in few hands or captured by companies and 
                            individuals based outside the Canary Islands — or a combination of both.

                            Media usually highlights record-breaking figures for tourist arrivals and revenue, yet the living 
                            conditions of the locals receive less attention. So, when Canarians take to the streets to protest 
                            against the current model — demanding change —, the data shows they have good reasons to do so. These 
                            protests are not directed at tourists themselves, but at a system that fails to redistribute the wealth 
                            generated in the islands.

                            Another aspect of this economic boom that I haven't covered in the post is how it is shaping the 
                            islands' demographics and how it is adding extra pressure on housing. That, however, is for another 
                            post. Stay tuned!
