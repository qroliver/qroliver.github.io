                    Lanzarote is no exception to global climate change, and data from 
                    <a href="https://www.aemet.es/es/portada" target="_blank">Aemet</a> recorded at Lanzarote Airport confirms 
                    this (fig. 1). Record-breaking years like 2023 and 2010 were the hottest on record, closely followed by 2024, 
                    which had a mean annual temperature of 22.3°C (fig. 1). This is almost 1°C higher than the 1991-2020 
                    reference period, and around 2°C higher than the 1970s average.

                    While the 1970s saw an average of 26 tropical nights per year (defined as days in which the minimum 
                    temperature recorded was above 20°C), this number has quadrupled over the past three decades, with recent 
                    years recording over 100 tropical nights annually (fig. 3).

                    (fig. 4 & 5). This made 2024 the second warmest year on record, only behind the record-breaking 2023. 
                    Most of the years with positive temperature anomalies relative to the 1991-2020 average are recent (fig. 5),

                    There is a clear pattern: temperatures are rising and this trend is likely to continue (see fig. 6 for a 
                    forecast for the next five years using a simple SARIMA model; MAPE: 2.21%, RMSE: 0.54). That's why, alongside mitigation efforts, we must 
                    prioritise the development of adaptation policies without delay.

                    An ambitious plan could include the following:

                <ul class="entry-paragraph-list">
                    <li>
                        Creation of <strong>shaded areas</strong> using native and drought-resistant plants (parks, 
                        tree-covered pedestrian areas, etc.). This is especially important in areas affected by the urban 
                        heat effect, like Arrecife.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using <strong>reflective colours</strong> and <strong>construction materials</strong> (aligned with the 
                        island's traditional architecture) that <strong>reduce heating from direct sunlight</strong>. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reducing traffic</strong> across the island (particularly in high-traffic zones like Arrecife). 
                        To achieve this, measures to implement could include: development of an <strong>efficient public transport system</strong>; 
                        build a <strong>bike lane network</strong> across the island (wherever possible and, ideally, separated 
                        from general traffic lanes); expansion of <strong>tree-covered pedestrian areas</strong> in the cities; etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Related to the previous point, creation of <strong>low-emission zones</strong> (especially in Arrecife).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Restoring and expanding water-related infrastructure</strong> to allow, in an efficient manner, 
                        for the efficient placement of <strong>public fountains</strong> in strategic places, the development of 
                        <strong>tree-covered areas</strong>, etc. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tax <strong>incentives</strong> to accelerate the transition.
